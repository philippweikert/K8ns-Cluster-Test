# Daily summary of Monday

I can't belive it! I mean, what the heck is going on, checked the problem again, didn't find a hinch, made reboot and bam, it works...can't stop laughing! 
Okay, I will get some Volumes set...for real this time

Okay, I think the Cluster is ready! I'm kind proud but also a bit disappointed, that it's consumed this much time, because of some Rookie-misstakes.
