# Daily summary from Tuesday

- yesterday I had the plan to put a back-up-system with velero in the Cluster
- test failed, and I was runnign out of time, so I decided to start today over
- after a slight error on my page it seems to work, will start a trial now
- trial worked fine, now I will set it for my app
- set a daily backup for 12 o'clock, so we will see at 12 o'clock, how it works, with `velero backup create` it worked.
- I plan also to expose minio to the outside, maybe, if I'm crazy, try it with ingress-didn't managed today
- got trouble executing scheduled backups, no wonder, my cluster lives in a different timezone 
- not working yet, will check this out later that week
- starting to read into Network-Virtualization
