# Daily summary of Thursday

Today I plan to get things together and deploy some stuff.
- I want to build a volume
- I want to get this ssh-stuff straight
- Deploy some stuff and access it

Okay it looks like something is wrong, and I'm not sure what it is. I can't access any Deployments and SSH-Connection to the Servers is not working. So something is terribly wrong and I have no idea what it is. Devastating! <br>
I'm thinking about to start over again from scratch, don't know if it is a smart idea. Need to think about it for a while.
I asked for help and we will work it out (hopefully!)
Meanwhile I made some experiments with k3s on my own machine, following this [guide](https://medium.com/swlh/kubernetes-external-ip-service-type-5e5e9ad62fcd)
Didn't worked out as I expected. Very disappointing! 

I can't think anymore, I will return to some learning for today.
