# Daily summary
The Day started with struggles to connect me to the Lab, after almost 2 hours, in which we found out, my User wasn't correctly set up. After this done, I received a brief introduction how to use our Lab.
I started to set up all the prerequisites to start my VMs, which included to integrate a new ISO for Ubuntu 20.04, which took some time as well.
After Lunch I started to set the VMs in a state, in which I can start runnung a Cluster on it. I'm confident to get it done by today, so I can Start tomorrow with the Cluster.
I needed some Help setting the Network, because I wasn't sure how to handle this with Ubuntu-Server and the Preinstall-Menues didn't gave me the chance to perform changes.
I wrote this and push it to github, I needed to set some things first at my PC to get everything done, but I'm not yet quite sure, how to contribute it in the Units-Repos.
