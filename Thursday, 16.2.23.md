# Daily summary from Thursday

- after having my CKA-Examen, I got back to work with the Cluster
- the ingress is not working 100 % as I wished it would: I can curl the pods from the Server, but could not connect on browser
- I have the suspicion, that it is connected to the fact that pods are running on a closed network
- I think my assumptions were wrong, will try tommorrow to get it done
- I think something is not right with th certs
