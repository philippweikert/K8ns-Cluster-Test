# Ideas and sort of Braindump
I'm sorry my head is sort of a mess, so I tried to keep you on track, if it doesn't work, I'm even more sorry. :D

- I wanted to keep it simple and easy to handle, not a huge fan of complicated stuff, so kubeadm is my friend
- I wanted to try out as much as possible and if possible to get nuts with possible tools to use
- I used CRI-O as runtime, cause never used it before and it's a CNCF-Project, so could be that wrong
- I read some stuff about Cilium, want to try it, it is just a pure gutt-feeling-thing, have the impression it is kind of mighty
- the structure of the repo should be easy to follow and gave the user good understanding what I'm up for here
- get my vs code pimped so I can have a good md experience (imput by Marco)
- also get a step by step intro, also inspired by Marco
