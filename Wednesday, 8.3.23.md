# Daily summary of Wednesday

- some strange problem with ingress and tls cert appeared, fixed it byy creating new cert, key and secret
- got the scheduled backup thing to work today, had a issue with flagging I assume, need to check out those flags a bit more in detail
- continued reading about network virtualization 
- main-time I spend putting a velero backup, the 'dirty' way on, was fun, but not as hard as expected, had trouble with " " again!!!! (took the wrong ones...)
